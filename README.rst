With the Power Plant Geostorage Interface it is possible to couple the simulation of storage and power plant operation.
The interface provides a data exchange between the sotrage and the power plant model and allows to utilize different simulations models.

Coupled Simulation
------------------

Description of the interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- modelinitialisation (read input time series, control files, prepare models)
- start loop for timestep

	- read power input/output from input time series, initial pressure from geological model
	- calculate input/output mass flow and actual power with power plant model (at given pressure level and power requirement)
	- calculate actual pressure and mass flow with geological storage model
	- check convergence:

		- assumed power of power plant model vs. actual pressure (go back to 2.2, recalculate mass flow)
		- pressure limits of storage (go back to 2.2, reduce mass flow, calculate power input/output)

	- write data to output file, if convergence aachieved or number of iterations exceeded:

		- timestamp
		- power
		- pressure
		- mass flow rate
		- temperature at boreholen (optional)


Input data

Geological Storage Module
-------------------------

Power Plant Module
------------------

The power plant module handles the power plant simulation. There are two main functions of the power plant module:

- Calculate the mass flow pressed into or extracted from the storage for a given pressure level at the bottom of the borehole and given power input or output respectively.
- Calculate the power input (or output) at given mass flow and given pressure level. This function is e. g. required, if the scheduled power can not be reached due to restrictions of the storage or the power plant.

For this purpose a power plant model is based on single components, e. g. compressors, turbines (turbine stages), heat exchangers, control valves or piping, is set up.
The interface implementation supports two different approaches for calculation of interface functionalities as mentioned above:

- Importing a TESPy power plant model or
- using a two dimensional lookup table linking the three quantities (mass flow, pressure level and power) as well as an inverse function.

The following sections will introduce the different modeling approaches and outline their strenghts and weaknesses.

TESPy model
+++++++++++

TESPy (Thermal Engineering Systems in Python) is a modular and component based power plant design and simulation software.
The Software is designed to simulate stationary operation of power plants, district heating systems, heat pumps or similar applications.

By connecting different components with each other a network is created, which can be represented by a system nonlinear of equations.
As TESPy is a equation-based approach, the system of equations is additionally influenced by parameter specification of the user.
In order to calculate the stationary operation of the plant, the fluid properties and the fluid composition of all connections between the components of the network has to be identified.
Thus, the system's variables are: mass flow, pressure, enthalpy and mass fraction of the fluid components. Component parameters can optionally be used as additional variables of the system, e. g. for the layout of a pipe diameter.
In order to numerically solve the system of equations, TESPy uses the multi dimensonal Newtonâ€“Raphson method.

The value of the system variables is calculated accoring to equation (0.0) in every iteration i:

.. math::

	\vec{x}_{i+1}=\vec{x}_i-J\left(\vec{x}_i\right)^{-1}\cdot f\left(\vec{x}_i\right)

Therefor, the calculation of the residual values of the equations :math:`f\left(\vec{x}_i\right)` as well as the calculation of the inversed jacobian matrix :math:`J\left(\vec{x}_i\right)` is required.
The algorithm is terminated, if the magnitude of the equations (vector norm :math:`||f\left(\vec{x}_i\right)||`) is smaller than a specified residual value:

.. math::

	||f(\vec{x}_i)|| > \epsilon
	
[1] provides further detailed information on TESPy.
	
For the interface, the power plant model is loaded with the tespy.network_reader-module, allowing to load the plant's topology and parametrisation as tabular data (from .csv-format).
After loading the network it is still possible to change parameters (e. g. the depth of the wells) provided in the general interface parameter settings.
Based on these settings a plant design calculation will be performed. The offdesign operation will reference this design point.

Proxy model
+++++++++++

The main reason for implementing a proxy model in the interface is reduction of calculation time. The proxy model is a two dimensional lookup table,
linking the key figures of the compressed air energy storage to each other.
